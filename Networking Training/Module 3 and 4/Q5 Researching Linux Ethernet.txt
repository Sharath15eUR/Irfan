Linux assigns names like eth0, ens33, or wlan0 to network interfaces. 
Running `ip link show` gave me a list of all available interfaces.

Ethernet communication in Linux works through different layers. 
Applications send network requests, the kernel processes them using protocols like TCP/IP, and network drivers handle the actual communication with the physical network card.

I used `sudo tcpdump -i eth0` to see packets moving in and out of the interface.

Network drivers in Linux are loaded as kernel modules. Some common ones are:

- e1000 (Intel)
- r8169 (Realtek)
- tg3 (Broadcom)

I checked which driver my system was using with `lsmod | grep e1000`.

Configuring Ethernet manually was another useful thing I learned. 
Assigning an IP:
`sudo ip addr add 192.168.1.10/24 dev eth0`

To enable or disable an interface using:
`sudo ip link set eth0 up` (enable)
`sudo ip link set eth0 down` (disable)

Overall, the Linux kernel efficiently manages Ethernet communication, handling everything from packet transmission to network driver support.
