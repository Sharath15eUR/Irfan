To configure a basic LAN interface in Linux, the first thing to do is check the available network interfaces using:
`ip link show`
This will list all network interfaces, including Ethernet (eth0, ens33, etc.). 

If the interface is down, it needs to be enabled with:
`sudo ip link set eth0 up`

Next, to manually assign an IP address to the Ethernet interface:
`sudo ip addr add 192.168.1.10/24 dev eth0`
This assigns the IP 192.168.1.10 with a subnet mask of /24 to the Ethernet interface. 

If the network requires a gateway, it can be added like this:
sudo ip route add default via 192.168.1.1

To verify that the configuration is working, running:
`ip addr show eth0` will show the assigned IP.
`ping 192.168.1.1` confirms network connectivity.

If everything is set up correctly, the system should be able to communicate within the LAN.
