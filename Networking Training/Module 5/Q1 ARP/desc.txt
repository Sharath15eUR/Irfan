In an ARP request, the sender asks, "Who has this IP?" by broadcasting the request on the network. It includes the senderâ€™s IP and MAC address. The device with the matching IP responds with an ARP reply, providing its MAC address. This allows the sender to map the IP to a MAC and send packets correctly.
