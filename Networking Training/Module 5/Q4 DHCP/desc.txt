When a device connects to a network, it follows the DORA process to get an IP from the DHCP server:

Discover – The client broadcasts a request for a DHCP server.
Offer – The server responds with an available IP and other details.
Request – The client asks to lease the offered IP.
Acknowledge – The server confirms the lease, and the client starts using the IP.
