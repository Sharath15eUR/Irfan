NAT (Network Address Translation) allows devices with private IPs to access the internet by replacing their private IP with a public IP assigned by the ISP. When a device with a private IP (e.g., 192.168.10.5) sends a request to the internet, NAT translates it to the public IP. The response from the internet is then translated back to the private IP, ensuring communication works seamlessly.
