ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) is essential for packet forwarding because devices communicate using MAC addresses within a network. When a device needs to send data to another device, it first uses ARP to find the MAC address associated with the destination IP. Without ARP, devices wouldnâ€™t know where to send packets, making communication within a local network impossible.
