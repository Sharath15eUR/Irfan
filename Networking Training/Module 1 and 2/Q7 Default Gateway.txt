1. In Linux, we can check your default gateway using:
ip route show

Example output:
default via 192.168.1.1 dev eth0 proto dhcp metric 100

Here, 192.168.1.1 is the default gateway.

2. Use the ping command to check connectivity:
ping -c 4 192.168.1.1

If we receive replies (64 bytes from 192.168.1.1), the gateway is reachable.
If there's no response (Destination Host Unreachable or Request Timed Out), the gateway is not reachable.

3. Understanding the Default Gateway
The default gateway is a router or network device that connects your local network to external networks (like the internet).
All outgoing traffic that doesn't match a local route is sent through the default gateway.
If the gateway is unreachable, internet access may not work.
